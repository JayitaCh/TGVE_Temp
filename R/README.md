## Serving the app via R (using Plumber)

The structure of this application is a Plumber app, so you can use the package to drive this project.

If you just like to run the app in R, all you need is the simple `run.R` script and you should have the `R/plumber.R` API up and running serving the `build` folder of the front-end.

Therefore, just clone the repo and run `Rscript run.R`.
