Template Repo

## Using this template repo
TODO: bring section of eAtlas notes related to this repo here.

## Notes

* This template is a "clean" [CRA](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) app with eatlas as the only component.

* All actios use `yarn` just because CRA usses yarn by default.

* Currently uses the beta release of of eatlas. 
  * Locks mapbox (via react-map-gl & plotly) to 1.10.x to avoid license issues.

* Locked react-scripts version to `3.4.4` due to a `url-loader` [issue](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/9870).
